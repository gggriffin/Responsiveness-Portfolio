                 <p>Hey, my name is Garrett Griffin and I am student of the KU
                Coding Bootcamp. I'm currently enrolled in the fullstack 
                development course and will be showcasing my classwork and
                independent projects in this portfolio, so check back in to
                see my progress over the next few months.
                </p>
                <p>When not programming, I generally spend my time with my wife,
                Sophia, and my pug, Jack Danger. Lately, it's been brutally
                cold in my hometown of Kansas City, but during the nicer parts
                of the year, I spend a lot of time playing disc golf. Kansas 
                City has some amazing disc golf locations, but one of my favorite
                past times is traveling around the country to play a wide 
                variety of courses. 
                </p>
                <p>Sophia and I also take a lot of trips camping and hiking. We have
                quite a few local parks that we like to go to, and we've been lucky
                enough to take several larger trips to state and national parks all over
                the U.S. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Thanks for checking out my work! I'm very excited to keep learning
                and will update when I have more!
                </p>
